A small database based on TXT document processing, C++, haha. . . . ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‰
# [ä¸­æ–‡]()  
# Using help:  
Operate with the help of a command line interface. Each user created is equivalent to creating a new txt document, storing user information (user name and password) in the first two lines of the document, and then storing the data.
### Data structure:
A string + an integer number + a pointer form a linked list, and the user information is stored at the first node of the linked list.

1.help can print out the brief introduction of the command on the screen.  
2.change can modify user information when data is not yet entered.  
3.delete delete the user.  
4.creat creates a user.  
5.read reads a user's data.  
6.write write a user's data.
